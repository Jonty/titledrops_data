Why
===

I always wondered what the earliest title drop in a movie is. I never finished my previous attempts to figure it out, but thanks to titledrops I have.

Anyway, its [The Tesseract (2003)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374273/), where not only does someone say "The Tesseract" after 13 seconds - they are also the first words spoken in the film!
